      <p>A small business uses a star network to keep its devices connected and working efficiently. At the center is a switch that connects all the computers, printers, and other devices in the office. The switch is connected to a router, which provides internet access for tasks like emails, video calls, and browsing. A firewall is added to protect the network from online threats and keep company data safe. </p>

 <p>The computers in the business are directly connected to the network through a switch. This will make file sharing easy and allow easy access to the company's database while using shared devices, such as printers. The sales team, for example, will quickly update the customer's order or check on the product details while at work. </p>

<p>The router also offers Wi-Fi, so laptops and tablets can stay connected anywhere in the office. This fast and reliable connection means that employees can hold online meetings or download files without interruptions. </p>

<p>The best thing about this setup is that if one computer or cable stops working, it doesn't affect the rest of the network. This keeps everything running smoothly and avoids delays. </p>

<p>Overall, the star network keeps the business organized, secure, and productive day after day. </p>
