    <h1>Understanding Different Network Topologies</h1>
    <h2>What Are Network Topologies?</h2>
    <p>
        Network topologies describe how computers, devices, or nodes are connected in a network. Different layouts 
        are used based on the size, purpose, and requirements of the network. Letâ€™s look at some common network 
        topologies: mesh, star, and bus.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Mesh Topology</h2>
    <p>
        In a mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device in the network. This creates multiple 
        paths for data to travel, making it very reliable. If one connection fails, data can still take another route. 
        Mesh topology is often used in systems where reliability is very important, like in military or banking networks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Highly reliable because of multiple connections.</li>
        <li>Good for networks that need constant uptime.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be expensive due to the many connections needed.</li>
        <li>Harder to set up and manage in large networks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Star Topology</h2>
    <p>
        In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub manages the flow of data 
        between the devices. This setup is common in homes and small offices because it is easy to set up and maintain.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to set up and troubleshoot.</li>
        <li>If one device fails, the rest of the network is not affected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the central hub fails, the whole network stops working.</li>
        <li>More cabling is needed compared to some other topologies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Bus Topology</h2>
    <p>
        In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single cable called a "bus." Data travels along the cable, 
        and each device picks up the data intended for it. Bus topology is simple and inexpensive, often used in 
        small networks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy and cheap to set up.</li>
        <li>Works well for small networks with limited devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down.</li>
        <li>Performance decreases as more devices are added.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Which Topology Is Best?</h2>
    <p>
        The best topology depends on your needs. For reliability, mesh is ideal. For simplicity, star is a great 
        choice. For cost-effectiveness in small networks, bus topology works well. Understanding these layouts can 
        help you design a network that meets your goals.
