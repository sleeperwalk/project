        <h1>The Role of Computer Systems in Healthcare</h1>
        <h2>Improving Patient Records</h2>
        <p>
            Computer systems play an important role in organizing patient information. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) 
            store medical data like test results, medications, and treatment history. This makes it easy for doctors and 
            nurses to find the information they need quickly. It also helps reduce errors, like giving a patient a 
            medication they might be allergic to. With EHRs, healthcare teams can work together more effectively and 
            provide better care.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Helping with Remote Healthcare</h2>
        <p>
            Telemedicine has changed the way people access healthcare. Computer systems allow patients to talk to 
            doctors online using video calls or apps. This is especially helpful for people living far from hospitals 
            or clinics. Devices like fitness trackers and health monitors can also send real-time data, such as heart 
            rate or blood pressure, directly to a doctor. This allows doctors to monitor their patients without needing 
            in-person visits.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Making Predictions with Data</h2>
        <p>
            Computers are good at analyzing large amounts of data. In healthcare, they can help predict problems 
            before they happen. For example, computer systems can find patterns in patient records and suggest when 
            someone might develop a disease. This helps doctors take action early, improving patient outcomes. These 
            systems can also recommend treatments that are most likely to work for each person.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Saving Time and Money</h2>
        <p>
            Hospitals use computer systems to manage tasks like scheduling appointments, billing, and keeping track 
            of supplies. These systems save time for staff, allowing them to focus more on patient care. Automating 
            these tasks also reduces costs, making healthcare more affordable for patients.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Future Potential</h2>
        <p>
            While computer systems have many benefits, there are challenges too. One big concern is keeping patient 
            information secure from hackers. Hospitals are investing in better security systems to protect sensitive 
            data. In the future, new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data systems will make 
            healthcare even more efficient and personalized. These tools will help improve diagnoses, discover new 
            treatments, and make healthcare better for everyone.
