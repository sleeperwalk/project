      <p>The library staff can use the database to manage all aspects of library operations in an efficient manner. The Books table enables them to track available titles, their genres, and publication details. The Authors table stores information about the authors, which can be linked to their books for easy reference.</p>

<p>All members registered in the library will be recorded in the Members table, including their contact details and membership status. The staff records all loan transactions in the Loans table, which tracks which books are checked out, to whom they were issued, and when they should be returned. </p>

<p>With this database, staff can easily search for the availability of a book, check the works of an author, or remind members of overdue returns. It also helps in maintaining accurate inventory, managing member details, and generating reports for better library planning.</p>
