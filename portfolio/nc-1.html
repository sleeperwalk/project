<h1>AI and Cybersecurity</h1>
<br>

<p>Computer Science has many areas that impact our daily lives. Two important ones are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity. These fields make technology useful and safe for everyone.</p>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence Helping People and Businesses</h2>
<p>AI is when machines can think and learn like humans. It uses data to find patterns, solve problems, and make decisions. AI helps businesses work faster and smarter.</p>
<p>For example, in healthcare, AI can find diseases by looking at medical images. It also helps doctors predict patient outcomes and plan treatments. In transportation, self-driving cars use AI to drive safely by analyzing data from their surroundings.</p>
<p>AI also makes customer experiences better. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use it to recommend products or shows. Farmers use AI to save water and grow more crops. AI is improving many areas of life and work.</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity Keeping Data Safe</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity protects our digital world. It keeps information, networks, and systems safe from hackers and other threats. This is important because so much of our personal and business data is online.</p>
<p>In banking, cybersecurity stops fraud by finding unusual activities. In government, it keeps sensitive data safe from attacks. Businesses use tools like firewalls and encryption to protect customer information.</p>
<p>With more devices connecting to the internet, like smart home gadgets, cybersecurity is even more important. It helps prevent risks and ensures these devices are safe to use.</p>

<h2>How AI and Cybersecurity Work Together</h2>
<p>AI and cybersecurity support each other. AI helps by spotting threats quickly and fixing them, while cybersecurity protects AI systems from being hacked. Together, they make technology safer and more reliable.</p>

<p>In conclusion, AI and cybersecurity are key parts of Computer Science. They improve our lives by making technology more helpful and secure. These fields will continue to shape the future of the digital world.</p>
